As I solve problems, I'll be putting the solution here</li>\n<li>Getting into the air howtos : there are a lot of tutorials which are the most basic of &quot;How to use technology X&quot;. But often there's a significant gap to actually using that effectively. So these Howto articles will go through using a tool more indepth.</li>\n<li>Reading reports : Mostly so I don't forget the things I've read, and maybe they'll be useful for you too.</li>\n<li>Ideas (mostly about software) : I have ideas, and while they're not all good, some of them might be interesting.</li>\n</ul>\n",
