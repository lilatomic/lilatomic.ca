## What's happening here

Couple things I'll be doing:

- Filling in practical documentation : sometimes you want to know how to use a technology to *solve a problem*, not just in the abstract. As I solve problems, I'll be putting the solution here
- Getting into the air howtos : there are a lot of tutorials which are the most basic of "How to use technology X". But often there's a significant gap to actually using that effectively. So these Howto articles will go through using a tool more indepth.
- Reading reports : Mostly so I don't forget the things I've read, and maybe they'll be useful for you too.
- Ideas (mostly about software) : I have ideas, and while they're not all good, some of them might be interesting.
